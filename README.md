This is a design for an online diary that records the day-to-day activities of its users. There is an index page with the signup and signin pages as navbars. New users are allowed to sign up where they provide their personal details including their email. After signing up, there is a database that stores the email and password of signed up users. The user is then allowed to sign in where he is taken to the home page. This home page is the page where the user adds new records. The home page cannot be accessed unless the user has signed in. This home page contains a page that displays all the user's record together with the time the record was taken note of and a logout page. There is also an admin page where the admin sees the emails of everyone that has signed up together with all the records of all the different users and the dates/times those records were recorded.
